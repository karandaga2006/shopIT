ShopIT is an e-commerce website developed as a three tier project for CMPE 273 (Enterprise Distributed Systems) course.
The first stage is implementing a shopping catalog using Node.js, ExpressJS and MongoDB.
Second stage deals with user account, order and inventory management using Java, JSP, Servlets and MySQL.
Third stage extends the inventory management implementation to include REST APIs. Python Flask is used for this.
